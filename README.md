# 🚀 Journey To The End – 2D Endless Runner Prototype

**Journey To The End** is a fast-paced **2D endless runner** where the player controls a ship dodging incoming asteroids.  
This was my **first 2D game prototype**, and it laid the foundation for everything I’ve learned about 2D game development.

## 🎮 Project Overview

> **"This was my first 2D prototype and it is an endless runner style game."**

**Journey To The End** was designed to help me learn the **core mechanics of 2D games**, including movement, spawning obstacles, collision detection, and UI management.  
The game features:

- 🚀 A ship that continuously moves forward
- ☄️ Asteroids spawning at varying speeds and angles
- 🎯 A score counter tracking survival time or distance
- 🗺️ Multiple map backgrounds to choose from for visual variety

## 🧠 What I Learned

*Journey To The End* was my introduction to 2D prototyping and game design in Unity. Through this project, I gained experience with:

- 🕹️ Basic 2D player movement and physics
- ⚠️ Object collision and event handling
- 🛠️ Setting up simple UI elements and score tracking
- 🌠 Building infinite scrolling mechanics
- 🎮 Core gameplay loop design and player feedback

> This prototype helped me build the confidence to explore more complex 2D and 3D projects and laid the groundwork for future systems.
